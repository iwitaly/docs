# Apple App Privacy

Starting December 8, 2020, Apple requires a privacy disclosure for all new apps and app updates. Adapty is a third-party dependency to your app, therefore you‚Äôll need to properly disclose the ways you are using Adapty in regards to user's data.

## Required Data Types

### Purchases

When using Adapty, you must disclose that your app collects ‚ÄòPurchases‚Äô information.

![](../.gitbook/assets/cleanshot-2020-12-07-at-23.52.47-2x%20%281%29.png)

#### 1. Purchase History

You should select at least the following options for 'Purchase History':

![](../.gitbook/assets/cleanshot-2020-12-07-at-23.57.49-2x.png)

* Selecting ‚ÄòAnalytics‚Äô ensures compliance for Adapty's dashboard features including [CRM](../profiles-and-promo-campaigns/profiles.md) and [Analytics](../analytics/advanced-analytics.md).
* Selecting ‚ÄòApp Functionality‚Äô ensures compliance for Adapty's receipt validation in order to prevent fraud.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are using Adapty for any of the other options listed, such as collecting data for Third-Party Advertising, you will need to select those options as well.
{% endhint %}

After selecting the options for Purchase History, click ‚ÄòNext‚Äô.

#### 2. Purchase History Linked to Identity

Apple will then ask if you are linking purchase history to a user‚Äôs identity. If you don't set **`customerUserId`**, and don't have a way to identify individual users, you can select ‚ÄòNo‚Äô.

If you are using **`customerUserId`** that can be tied to a user‚Äôs email address or phone number, you should select ‚ÄòYes‚Äô.

#### 3. Purchase History User Tracking

Finally, to indicate if purchase history data will be used for tracking purposes, you will need to read Apple‚Äôs examples and determine if your app meets their definitions of tracking.

Adapty, as a third-party, doesn't use purchase history to track users across different apps for advertising.

### Identifiers

If you are identifying users with **`customerUserId`**, you'll need to select 'User ID'.

Adapty collects IDFA, so you'll need to select 'Device ID'.

After making your selections, you'll need to indicate how the data is used similar to the Purchases section.

After making your privacy selections, Apple will show a preview of your app's privacy section. If you have chosen Purchases and Identifiers as described above, your app's privacy details should look something like this:
