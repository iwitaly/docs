# Reports

Reports provide you with the most relevant information in your inbox or Slack:

* Revenue
* Churn rate
* Active subscribers
* Active trials

You can find many more metrics in [Analytics](advanced-analytics.md).



### Slack integration

Open your [Adapty account](https://app.adapty.io/account) and authorize Adapty bot in the channel where you'd like to receive reports.
