# Event Feed

Event feed allows you to visually track [Events](integrations/#events) that Adapty generates from your users and check the status of their export to 3rd-party integrations, including your custom webhook.

Please note that AppsFlyer, Facebook Ads, and Branch sending status could be inaccurate as they do not always return errors when they occur.
