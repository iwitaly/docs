# FAQ

**Do you replace Apple/Google payment?**

No, we don't! We simplify and secure payment infrastructure for you but all payments are still processed by Apple or Google.

**How do you price?**

The actual version of the pricing available at [https://adapty.io/pricing](https://adapty.io/pricing).

**What is MTR?**

MTR is a monthly tracked revenue. It's the amount of revenue tracked by Adapty \(in USD, and before the platform cut\) during a one month billing period. This includes paid subscriptions, renewals, and one-time purchases.

**What are overages?**

All plans include a base MTR. If you exceed this amount, overages are automatically charged from your account.

For example, if you're on Pro plan and your MTR is $35k, than you pay $99 + \(35 - 20\) _\* $5.99 = $99 + 15  \*_ $5.99 = $173.85

**What if my MTR goes over $10k on a Free plan?**

Don't worry, Adapty continues to handle your purchases and validates receipts. However, you won't have access to the rest of the features, including [Analytics](analytics/basic-analytics.md) and [Reports](analytics/reports.md). To unlock access you need to upgrade your plan.

**Ooops, I have a billing issue with my card, will you cancel our SDK?**

No, we won't. Adapty continues to handle your purchases and validates receipts. You will be prompt with a paywall and after paying you can continue to use all features of Adapty.

**Is my data safe?**

Yes. We use AWS \(Amazon Web Services\) for web hosting and we care about your privacy. We use SSL encryption, OTP, and more to prevent data leaks. We spend time on safety because security means quality for us. We do not sell your data.
