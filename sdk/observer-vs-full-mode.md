# Observer vs Full

There are two ways to integrate Adapty SDK: Observer mode and Full mode.

### **Observer mode**

Observer mode gives you full analytics capabilities:

* Integrations including attribution systems;
* Advanced Analytics;
* Profiles CRM.

Integrating it usually takes under an hour, you'll only need to implement a couple of SDK methods. You can use Observer mode along with existing purchases infrastructure.



### Full mode

Full mode adds multiple features on top of Observer:

1. Complete purchases infrastructure: managing access to the app including lifetime, handling renewals, billing retries, subscription offers, grace periods, etc.;
2. A/B testing;
3. Promo Campaigns.

Integration takes several hours, and in most cases, you should use Full mode as a complete solution for your app purchase infrastructure.
